## Experience

This specific project went reletively well. I was able to get it done at least, and it seems to work as it should according to the prompts. It did take me a while to connect all the pieces together, because I had to go back and remember how to do everything from the previous week. I also had one big issue with the server.js file that took me forever to solve. The issue was that I called the res.render method twice, causing it to crash before even loading properly. Otherwise, it was mostly just a time sink to get everything back up to speed so that I could complete it properly.

## Known issues or Bugs

I'm not sure that this counts as a bug or issue, but something I would have prefered is to design a script that would call the get method everytime the webpage is upadated, but instead I just went with a simple copy and paste of the get code into the push methods so that everytime they are called, the get method also effectively goes off, keeping the webpage updated. I did this because I couldn't figure out how to call the get method properly otherwise in javascript, but perhaps I just missed it where I was trying to find a solution in the textbook.
